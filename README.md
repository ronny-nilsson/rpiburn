# rpiburn
Raspberry power supply testing, while monitoring system for anomalies.

rpiburn is a tool for heavy load Raspberry Pi hardware testing. It will make the board to consume as much current as possible, but aborts if the processor becomes overheated, a brownout (under voltage) condition occur or something else bad happens. Note that **board** consumption is of interest! This is not necessarily the same as maxing out the processor (although that's used too). Testing can be conducted in the background, the program tries to be nice with limited resources. ItÂ´s also quite fast; usually testing finishes in less than two seconds.

### Measured values
| Pi model | Current (mA)                    |
| -------- | ------------------------------- |
| 1B+      | 320                             |
| 2B       | 650                             |
| 3B       | 1300 with Neon and 830 without  |
